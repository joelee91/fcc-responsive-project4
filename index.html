        Introduction

      <p>
        Before we dive into Javascript, make sure you have a proper understanding
        on basic HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, Javascript is a programming language that allows interactivity on a static webpage filled with
        HTML & CSS. We can implement features that allow for animations, data interactivity, & any other user
        interaction we can think of.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML, CSS, & Javascript work together to create a complete front-end application and can be compared
        as such:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>HTML</b> is a markup language that provides the skeleton, or structure, of a webpage. We can see
          examples of this by how the paragraphs appear on this webpage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CSS</b> is a language used to style HTML code, such as, setting font size and color, to the flow of
          the content within the webpage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Javascript</b> is as mentioned above, a scripting language used to create dynamic content that allows
          for user interactivity as well as animations.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Getting Started

      <p>
        It is normally advised to write Javascript in a separate file within a text editor, however, for the
        purposes of this guide, we will be writing our code within the console of a web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        On mac while using google chrome, to open the console use the command CMD + OPTION + J. This will open
        a console on the side of the browser where we can then begin writing our code. It would be wise to become
        familiar with the console as it is one of the best tools for developers.
      </p>

    <section id="variables" class="main-section">

        Variables
      </header>
      <p>
        Variables are the building blocks of Javascript, which allow us to store information(values) such as numbers
        and strings that would be commonly used in sentences. For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        let hello = "hello world!";
      </code>
      <p>
        Let's examine this piece of code. First, we are "declaring" or creating a variable by using the keyword
        'let'. 'let' can be replaced by 'var' or 'const' as keywords depending on the usage and situation, shown below:
      </p>
      <code>
        var hello = "hello world!";
        const hello = "hello world!";
      </code>
      <p>
        but we will get into that later. <br> <br>
        The word that follows 'let' is purely a naming convention that we use to name our
        variables. We take this variable and make it equal or 'initialize' a value, in this case a string of text. This
        string of
        text "hello world!" is a value that is stored within our variable 'hello'.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now we have a variable and a stored value within it, we can then use this variable or 'call' it to
        create an output by writing 'hello' in our console.
      </p>
      <code>
        hello;
      </code>
      <p>
        So far, we should have the code exactly as follows in our console:
      </p>
      <code>
        let hello = "hello world!";
        undefined
        hello;
        "hello world!"
      </code>
      <p>
        Declaring our variable return undefined, however, this is not important or relevant. The next line of code
        is where we call our variable 'hello', which then returned the value or string 'hello world'. <br>
        We can now call hello as many times as we want as it is now stored data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we move on to the next section, it is important to note that both single and double quotations
        can be used for our strings. Also, semicolons after each line of code is not necessary, but a good habit
        to form later on.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="variable_types" class="main-section">
      <header>
        Variable Types
      </header>
      <p>
        As mentioned earlier, we briefly discussed that variables store information/data for us to utilize throughout
        our code. There are different types of data (a.k.a. data types) that we can store, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strings</li>
        <li>Numbers</li>
        <li>Booleans</li>
        <li>Arrays</li>
        <li>Objects</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We already went over strings, so let's move on to numbers. The syntax for declaring a variable with a number
        data type is slightly different from strings, as shown:
      </p>
      <code>
        let number = 5;
      </code>
      <p>
        We can see that there are no quotations surrounding the number 5 and that is because quotations would then
        turn the data type of 5 from a number to a string. This is important as different outcomes will occur
        if we try to add two strings together as opposed to two numbers. For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        let number = 5;
        number + 5;
        10;

        let number = "5";
        number + 5;
        "55"
      </code>
      <p>
        A number data type is able to perform as numbers/integers originally do when faced with operators,
        whereas the string will take the number 5 and simply combine with another integer or string without
        following simple operator rules such as addition or subtraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        We won't be going over the rest of the data types, however, I strongly encourage you to further read upon
        how we use them and the correct syntax usage as well.

        Updating Variables
      </header>
      <p>
        Once we declare variables, we are able to call on them whenever we want, as many times as we want, however,
        what if we wanted to change the value of the variable? Well, we can:
      </p>
      <code>
        let myName = "Joe";
        myName;
        "Joe";

        myName = "Nick";
        myName;
        "Nick";
      </code>
      <p>
        As you can see, we first declared a variable let with the name 'myName' and made it equal to the value
        'Joe', so that when we call on the variable 'myName', the output would be 'Joe'.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can then take the variable 'myName' and make it equal to another value, in this case 'Nick'. It is
        important to note that we do not use the keyword let again. After which we are then able to call on
        'myName' and have the output now be 'Nick'.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can usually change the value of the same variable, except in the case of 'const':
      </p>
      <code>
        const myName = 'Joe';
        myName = 'Nick';
        error
      </code>
      <p>
        By using the keyword 'const', we can manage our variables more carefully and prevent them from being
        changed throughout our code.
