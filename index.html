        Before we dive into Javascript, make sure you have a proper understanding
        on basic HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, Javascript is a programming language that allows interactivity on a static webpage filled with 
        HTML & CSS. We can implement features that allow for animations, data interactivity, & any other user
        interaction we can think of.

        HTML, CSS, & Javascript work together to create a complete front-end application and can be compared
        as such:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>HTML</b> is a markup language that provides the skeleton, or structure, of a webpage. We can see
          examples of this by how the paragraphs appear on this webpage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CSS</b> is a language used to style HTML code, such as, setting font size and color, to the flow of
          the content within the webpage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Javascript</b> is as mentioned above, a scripting language used to create dynamic content that allows
          for user interactivity as well as animations.
        </li>
      </ul>
