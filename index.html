        Before we dive into Javascript, make sure you have a proper understanding
        on basic HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, Javascript is a programming language that allows interactivity on a static webpage filled with
        HTML & CSS. We can implement features that allow for animations, data interactivity, & any other user
        interaction we can think of.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML, CSS, & Javascript work together to create a complete front-end application and can be compared
        as such:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>HTML</b> is a markup language that provides the skeleton, or structure, of a webpage. We can see
          examples of this by how the paragraphs appear on this webpage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CSS</b> is a language used to style HTML code, such as, setting font size and color, to the flow of
          the content within the webpage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Javascript</b> is as mentioned above, a scripting language used to create dynamic content that allows
          for user interactivity as well as animations.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Getting Started

      <p>
        It is normally advised to write Javascript in a separate file within a text editor, however, for the
        purposes of this guide, we will be writing our code within the console of a web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        On mac while using google chrome, to open the console use the command CMD + OPTION + J. This will open
        a console on the side of the browser where we can then begin writing our code. It would be wise to become
        familiar with the console as it is one of the best tools for developers.

        Variables
      </header>
      <p>
        Variables are the building blocks of Javascript, which allow us to store information(values) such as numbers
        and strings that would be commonly used in sentences. For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        let hello = "hello world!";
      </code>
      <p>
        Let's examine this piece of code. First, we are "declaring" or creating a variable by using the keyword
        'let'. 'let' can be replaced by 'var' or 'const' as keywords depending on the usage and situation, shown below:
      </p>
      <code>
        var hello = "hello world!";
        const hello = "hello world!";
      </code>
      <p>
        but we will get into that later. <br> <br>
        The word that follows 'let' is purely a naming convention that we use to name our
        variables. We take this variable and make it equal or 'initialize' a value, in this case a string of text. This
        string of
        text "hello world!" is a value that is stored within our variable 'hello'.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now we have a variable and a stored value within it, we can then use this variable or 'call' it to
        create an output by writing 'hello' in our console.
      </p>
      <code>
        hello;
      </code>
      <p>
        So far, we should have the code exactly as follows in our console:
      </p>
      <code>
        let hello = "hello world!";
        undefined
        hello;
        "hello world!"
      </code>
      <p>
        Declaring our variable return undefined, however, this is not important or relevant. The next line of code
        is where we call our variable 'hello', which then returned the value or string 'hello world'. <br>
        We can now call hello as many times as we want as it is now stored data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we move on to the next section, it is important to note that both single and double quotations
        can be used for our strings. Also, semicolons after each line of code is not necessary, but a good habit
        to form later on.

        Variable Types
      </header>
      <p>
        As mentioned earlier, we briefly discussed that variables store information/data for us to utilize throughout
        our code. There are different types of data (a.k.a. data types) that we can store, such as strings, numbers,
        booleans, arrays, and objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        We already went over strings, so let's move on to numbers. The syntax for declaring a variable with a number
        data type is slightly different from strings, as shown:
      </p>
      <code>
        let number = 5;
      </code>
